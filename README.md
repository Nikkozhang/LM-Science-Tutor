## TutorEval

### üéì About
TutorEval is a question-answering benchmark which evaluates how well a language model (the *LM tutor*) can help a user understand a chapter from a science textbook. TutorEval contains over 800 questions written by 17 expert researchers covering math, computer science, physics, life sciences, and environmental science. TutorEval questions relate to chapters from [TutorChat](https://huggingface.co/datasets/princeton-nlp/TutorChat) (downloaded from [libretexts.org](https://libretexts.org)) and require the model to answer free-form questions written from the point of view of a student. TutorEval questions are very diverse: they may ask for explanations of complicated content, for additional information going beyond the chapter, for verifications of exercise solutions, etc. Download the TutorEval data from HuggingFace at [princeton-nlp/TutorEval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/princeton-nlp/TutorEval).

TutorEval uses an LM as an evaluator. Once the LM tutor has generated responses to TutorEval questions, the evaluator is prompted to compare the tutor's outputs with a set of ground-truth *key points*. These key points were written by the human experts who created TutorEval, and sketch the most important points that the tutor should cover when answering the student.

### üìñ OpenBook and üìï ClosedBook

TutorEval questions are very diverse and rely on the textbook chapter in different ways. Some questions explicitly refer to the chapter (*open-book*), and some questions are phrased in such a way that they can be understood without reading the textbook chapter (*closed-book*). This means that TutorEval contains two evaluations in one:

- üìñ TutorEval with open-book evaluation: this is our main setting and uses all 834 TutorEval questions. The LM tutor is prompted with the entire textbook chapter and the question. This requires LMs to process contexts up to 6,000 words.
- üìï TutorEval-ClosedBook: this evaluation uses the 370 closed-book questions in TutorEval and prompts the LM tutor without the chapter. This makes it possible to evaluate short-context LMs.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Evaluating on TutorEval

To evaluate your own model on TutorEval, please use the scripts provided in `./tutoreval`.

- `./tutoreval/generate.py` produces the LM tutor outputs and saves them under `./tutoreval/generations/openbook`, or `./tutoreval/generations/closedbook` for TutorEval-ClosedBook. The script `./tutoreval/generate.sh` provides some useful utilities for running your model.
- `./tutoreval/grade.py` uses GPT-4 as an evaluator to grade the LM tutor's outputs. The script `./tutoreval/grade.sh` also provides some utilities for grading.
- `./tutoreval/get_results.py` collects GPT-4's grades to give a breakdown of the final TutorEval performance.

See `./tutoreval/README.md` for detailed instructions.

## TutorChat
Download the TutorChat data from HuggingFace at [princeton-nlp/TutorChat](https://huggingface.co/datasets/princeton-nlp/TutorChat).

### Textbook chapters 
Download the processed textbook chapters from HuggingFace at [princeton-nlp/TextbookChapter](https://huggingface.co/datasets/princeton-nlp/TextbookChapters). This dataset was obtained by scraping [libretexts.org](https://libretexts.org) and processing the cleaned HTML files with the HTML-to-LaTeX parser from [Openwebmath](https://github.com/keirp/OpenWebMath). 

### TutorChat processing
`./tokenization/tokenize_tutorchat.py` tokenizes TutorChat and creates training labels according to the recipe used to train `Llemma-7B-32K-MathMix`. Use the flag `--stem_only` to tokenize only the STEM split of TutorChat.

### MathMix
MathMix is a fine-tuning dataset composed of the STEM split of TutorChat and a processed version of [MetaMath](https://huggingface.co/datasets/meta-math/MetaMathQA). In `./tokenization`, we provide some scripts to re-create and tokenize MathMix.

`./tokenization/tokenize_metamath.py` tokenizes MetaMath by randomly concatenating question/answer pairs to form longer samples. Use the flag `--num_concat` to set the number of samples to concatenate. MathMix concatenates 10 samples at a time. 

`./mathmix_combine.py` concatenates and shuffles the tokenized TutorChat and MetaMath datasets to create MathMix. Use the flags `--tutorchat` and `--metamath` to set the paths to your tokenized datasets created with `./tokenization/tokenize_tutorchat.py` and `./tokenization/tokenize_metamath.py`.

## Models
Download our models from HuggingFace at [princeton-nlp/Llemma-7B-32K-MathMix](https://huggingface.co/princeton-nlp/Llemma-7B-32K-MathMix) and [princeton-nlp/Llemma-34B-MathMix](https://huggingface.co/princeton-nlp/Llemma-34B-MathMix).
